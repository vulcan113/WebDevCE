        <h1>What is hidden content?</h1>
        <p>In-game, a  <a href="https://iron-lung.fandom.com/wiki/Terminal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">terminal</a> can be found in the back of the submarine that when opperated with, can have different
             prompts or codes put in to reveal hidden content the average man isn't supposed to see.

        <h1>Notable Records</h1>
        <h2>The Consolidation of Iron</h2>
        <p>"the consolidation of iron, or c.o.i, is a brotherhood of three space stations and two spacecrafts, found on
             the principle of collectivism and ruled by popular vote of all citizens (numbering 257 at the time of this entry).
              its name comes from the iron and steel materials its two main stations are constructed from, and the principle of
               unity and togetherness in the face of menace from other surrounding stations such as eden."</p>
        
        <h2>Blood Oceans</h2>
        <p>"an unexplained phenomenon that has been identified on four separate moons since the quiet rapture. moon at-5
             and moon z-8 are the most notable locations as they are under the control of the c.o.i. enough research has
              been conducted on the blood itself to determine that it is indeed human blood, but we have not discovered
             where it comes from or how it keeps its liquid form. the ocean on at-5 is of particular interest because 
             [redacted]" </p>
        
        <h2>The sm-8</h2>
        <p>"hopefully they don't redact this before updating the database. what most people don't understand is that not
             all subs are built equal. the sm-8 isn't a burner sub. it really is for exploring and surveying blood oceans.
              if they send you down in the iron lung they don't give a fuck if you come back, or if the sub comes back, 
              because it's a pile of garbage and you're a piece of shit. you come back with photos, great. you sit down 
              there and suffocate quietly, even better. but if they send the sm-8 down, one of the scientists is piloting
               and they all expect them to return. <br> <br>and now the sm-8 is in the blood ocean in pieces. no, not "hit a rock"
                pieces or "sprung a leak" pieces. it looks like something tore it up. and the weirdest thing is that nobody
                 else seems surprised. we might have found the first planetary life since the rapture, and they're acting 
                 like it's no big deal. I know you're next in line for realization in the iron lung, and usually that means
                  you won't be seeing the stars again. but they don't have a sm-8 anymore. they have 3 burner subs, and a 
                  lot of curiosity about at-5. and maybe that means you have a chance."</p>
