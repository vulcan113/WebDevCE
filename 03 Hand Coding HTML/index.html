        <p>The SM13 or the "Iron Lung" is a burner submarine provided by the C.O.I to search any remaining bodies of liquid 
            left in the universe. It's most recent use was for the blood ocean on the moon AT-5 to look for any useful
             materials that might be inside. The SM13 however, was never meant to go into such deep depths, so therefore
             the operator was sealed into the sub with no form of escape or contact with the outer world besides a radio, a
            front window and a front facing camera.</p>
        
        <h2>The Blood Ocean/AT-5</h2>
        <p>AT-5 is one of four moons that unusually has an ocean of blood on it's surface. The other moons are Z-8 and two
             unnamed moons. The moons show no sign of human life touching their surface besides the Blood Ocean, which indeed is 
             human blood. Where the blood came from is unknown.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Key Points</h2>
        <p>In the past, there was an event known as "The Quiet Rapture" where in one moment, every known habital planet, every 
            known star suddenly vanished with no rhyme or reason. Not a single soul saw what exactly happened when all the planets 
            and stars vanished. The location and state of the planets, stars and any living things that were on the planets is
             unknown.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Latest Mission of the SM13</h2>
        <p>The <strong>SM13</strong> submarine's most recent venture was on the moon at-5 in the blood ocean on the moon. Of course,
        however, the sub was never meant for the depths of the blood ocean on at-5. So the opperator, a convict on conviction realization,
        was sealed inside the submarine with no outer contact besides a front window, a radio, and a front facing camera cabable 
        of taking pictures. As for the convict, their task was to opperate the SM13 and do the following...</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate the ocean safely</li>
            <li>Find and document anomalies on the ocean floor</li>
            <li>Return with results</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Neither the convict, nor the SM13 returned.</p>
